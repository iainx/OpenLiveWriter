### Test Plan Procedures
* Go to the contributors repository - for example if I am the contributor, go to my repositories and get a copy, either by downloading the zip file or by cloning
* Build and run the code.  See https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter/wiki/Building,-Testing,-and-Debugging
* Attempt to recreate the bug
* Sanity Test -- I am creating checklists for sanity tests.  Test as many individual things as you possibly can.
* When you find a problem document it in the pull request.
